JFrame Setup:

java
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
JFrame frame = new JFrame("My Notepad Clone");
frame.setSize(600, 400);
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);

Text Area:

java
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
textArea = new JTextArea();
textArea.setLineWrap(true);
textArea.setWrapStyleWord(true);
frame.add(new JScrollPane(textArea), BorderLayout.CENTER);
A JTextArea is instantiated, and line wrapping is enabled. The text area is added to the center of the frame within a JScrollPane, allowing for scrolling if the text exceeds the visible area.

Menu Bar:

java
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
JMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();
JMenu fileMenu = new JMenu("File");
menuBar.add(fileMenu);
A JMenuBar is created, with a single menu labeled "File".

Menu Items: Several JMenuItem objects are created for various functionalities:

New: Clears the text area.
Open: Opens a file chooser to select a file to open and read its contents into the text area.
Save: Opens a file chooser to save the contents of the text area to a file.
Exit: Prompts the user to confirm if they want to exit the application.
java
Insert Code

Copy code
JMenuItem newItem = new JMenuItem("New");
newItem.addActionListener(e -> newFile());
fileMenu.add(newItem);
// Similar code for openItem, saveItem, and exitItem
Setting the Menu Bar:

frame.setJMenuBar(menuBar);
frame.setVisible(true);
The menu bar is added to the frame, and the frame is made visible.

Method Definitions

public static void main(String[] args) {
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(MyNotepadClone::new);
}
The main method is the entry point of the application. It uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater to ensure that the GUI is created on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), which is the standard practice for Swing applications.
